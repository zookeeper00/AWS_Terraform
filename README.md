1. modules/ Directory:

Contains reusable modules (e.g., ec2 and vpc).
Each module has its own main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf for modularity and reusability.
Add more modules as needed for other AWS resources (e.g., RDS, S3, etc.).

2. environments/ Directory:

Separate directories for different environments (dev, prod, etc.).
Each environment has its own main.tf, variables.tf, and terraform.tfvars to manage environment-specific configurations.

3. Root Level Files:

main.tf: Contains the root configuration that references the modules for a default/global deployment.
variables.tf: Defines global/shared variables across environments.
terraform.tfvars: Specifies values for the variables in the root configuration.
outputs.tf: Outputs the results of the deployment, such as instance IDs, IPs, etc.


1. main.tf (Root - 14):
When you need it: This file serves as an entry point for your infrastructure and can be used to call various modules if you're working with a global configuration. It is especially useful if you want to maintain a single source of truth for calling modules from different environments or if you need to customize some parts of the configuration across environments.
When it's not necessary: If you're managing separate environments (like dev and prod) through the environments directory and each environment has its own configuration (with its own main.tf), the root main.tf might not be required. In this case, you would directly work with environments/dev/main.tf or environments/prod/main.tf.
2. variables.tf (Root - 15):
When you need it: This file is useful if you have global variables that need to be accessed across multiple environments or modules. For instance, setting the AWS region or other global parameters.
When it's not necessary: If all your variables are environment-specific (e.g., only defined inside environments/dev/variables.tf or environments/prod/variables.tf), and you don't have any global variables that need to be shared, you can omit the root variables.tf.
3. outputs.tf (Root - 16):
When you need it: This file is useful if you want to collect and expose global outputs across your entire infrastructure. If you have multiple modules and need outputs to be easily accessible from a central place, it's useful.
When it's not necessary: If the outputs are environment-specific (e.g., defined only within environments/dev/outputs.tf or environments/prod/outputs.tf), you can omit the root outputs.tf file. Each environment can handle its own outputs.
